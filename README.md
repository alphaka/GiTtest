Github Test for Class

The purpose of the program is to determine the average of intergers.

I used command line arguments, meaning the program reads the integers entered
that are separated by space and put them into the array args.

A for loop is used to sum up the args array, then is divided by the length of args.

Finally, a message is displayed which has the average of the args array.
